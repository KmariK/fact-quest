### Design
#### Design Choices:
The webpage was designed with a simple, minimalist approach to enhance user experience. It is clear and intuitive, allowing users to easily understand the quiz's purpose and participate without any hassle. 

#### Colours:
For the colour scheme, bright colours were chosen to engage the user. I selected the colors by browsing through various options and choosing the ones that best suited the aesthetic and purpose of my site. I found my desired colours on [Image Color Picker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/) website and searched for there HEX Code. The two colours I chose are #d5dced; used for backround colour and #0dbffe; used for the logo font colour. 

#### Fonts:
The two main fonts are Press Start 2P which is the primary font with a fallback of sans-serif and Roboto which is the secondary font with a fall back of sans-serif.

#### Structure:
The page is structured in a easy, user friendly way. When the user arrives on the website they are immediately welcomed with the logo on the center of the page and above a familiar type of navigation bar to the right. The website consists of four pages:
1. A homepage with a navbar at the top and logo and a button to start the game. 
2. A about us page with a descriptive insight of what the quiz is about, who and where the game can be played. 
3. A quiz game page with a timer at the top that starts as soon as the page loads. The quiz has 10 questions, each with a matching image. Below each question are multiple choice answers, and a "Next" button lets the user move to the next question when a answer is chosen. 
4. A contact us page which consits of a contact form, email address and contact number.

### Testing

#### Manual Testing v Automated Testing 
- For manual testing I went through my website the same way a normal user would. I checked that all the links worked, the buttons responded properly, and the forms accepted valid input but rejected incorrect ones. I also opened the site on both desktop and mobile screens to make sure the layout stayed responsive and didnâ€™t break when resized.

- For automated testing I used Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools. This gave me an automated report on performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practices. It helped me spot a couple of areas where I could improve my site, like image optimization and making sure contrast ratios were good for readability.

 Overall, I combined manual testing (to check user interactions and responsiveness by hand) with a bit of automated testing (using Lighthouse to get objective performance and accessibility scores). This way I was able to confirm that the site works correctly for users and also meets modern web standards.

#### HTML Validation
- The W3S Markup Validation Service was used to validate the HTML of the website showing the validation before and after once it has been fixed.

| ----------- | ----------- |
| The menu not opening on smaller screen sizes (320px, 576px and 768px) | Copied the JS scripted tag from Bootstrap and attached it to all pages.  |
| Image on quiz game was not loading | Added 'image-wrapper' div id to html with the image src inside and on JS added 'const wrapEl = document.getElementById("image-wrapper");; to the loadQuestion fuction.
| Home page content was not centering to the middle of the page | The custom CSS code I had for the home page styling was conflicting with Bootstraps styles. So I had to remove it and replaced it with Bootstrap utility classes instead.
